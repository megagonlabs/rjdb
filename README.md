## üõ†Ô∏è **Dataset Construction Process**

### 1. **Skill-Occupation Graph Creation**
- **Base Graph:** Started with the publicly accessible **Skill-Occupation Graph** from **[DICE](https://www.dice.com/)**.  
- **Extension:** Expanded using job titles from the **[US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/)**.  
- **Skill Generation:** Used **GPT-4** to infer required skills for each job title.  
- **Skill Filtering:** Applied statistical filtering using aggregated insights from **proprietary Indeed skill-occupation graphs**.

### 2. **Sample Generation**
- Utilized **GPT-4** to generate resumes and job descriptions guided by the refined Skill-Occupation Graph.
